## 👤 Author  
Arpita N Sheelvanth  

## 📖 Project Overview  
This project converts **voice/audio input into text** and then applies **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to extract meaningful insights.  
It is designed as a web-based application with a simple, modern, and responsive interface.  

The application is useful for:  
- Students taking lecture notes  
- Professionals transcribing meetings  
- Analyzing speech data for patterns and sentiment

## 🚀 Features  
- 🎤 **Voice Input**: Record audio directly from the browser or upload an audio file (.mp3, .wav).  
- 📝 **Speech-to-Text Conversion**: Transcribes audio into text in real time.  
- 🧠 **NLP Processing**:  
  - Text cleaning & tokenization  
  - Stopword removal  
  - Word frequency analysis  
  - Sentiment analysis (Positive / Negative / Neutral)  
- 📊 **Visualization & Insights**:  
  - Word frequency charts/word cloud  
  - Sentiment distribution graphs  
  - Summary statistics (word count, unique words, sentence length)  
- 💾 **Export Options**:  
  - Download transcription as `.txt`  
  - Export analytics as `.pdf` or `.csv`
